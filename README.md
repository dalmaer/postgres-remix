# Remix

This directory is a brief example of a [Remix](https://remix.run/docs) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/dalmaer/postgres-remix&template=remix)

_Live Example: https://postgres-remix.vercel.app _

You can also deploy using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
